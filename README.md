# General Info

This project exists with the purpose of host a website for me. The website will operate such as a portfolio and CV. Hence, I'll show all my works, projects, and other stuff that I do. I took inspiration from [dark code](https://www.darkcode.info/) and his tutorials about a responsive website.

# Technologies

At the moment, I am not sure about what technologies use to create the website. Then, here is a list of the possible technologies used within this project:  

1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

I hope to learn other technologies in the future and implementing them within the website.
